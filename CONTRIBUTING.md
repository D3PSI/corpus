# Contributing to the Whitespace Corpus

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Whitespace Corpus to
ensure comprehensive, accurate information on the Whitespace language.

## Help wanted

### Documenting new projects

Do you know of any Whitespace projects that are not listed? If so,
[file an issue](https://github.com/wspace/corpus/issues) and I'll make
sure to add it.

### Docker

Adding dependency and build information that is sufficient to generate a
Dockerfile for each project.

### Building remaining projects

The current status of building and running each project is documented in
[building.md](./building.md).

### HaPyLi

I am seeking a copy of the HaPyLi language source as the HaPyLi website
is now defunct and the compiler and example programs were not archived.
